# Big<br>Faces

^ Intro the other
Where work, What do

---

### **Agenda**

## 1. What?
## 2. So what?
## 3. Now what?

^ 1. What (is perf)?
2. So what? (Why should we care?)
4. Now what (can we do)?

---

# **1. What?**

^ The Front-end of what?

---

# (Front-end)<br/>Performance

^ What's Front-end?
(e.g. vs back-end)
Simplified version of perf because time

---

# 1. Speed

![](img/speed.jpg)

^ (Speed has perceived vs actual)
Save time for users

---

# 2. Weight

![](img/weight.jpg)

^ (Initial page load vs later)
How much stuff
Cheap for users
Less stuff means less work means less time and money for us

---

# **2. So what?**

^ **hit you in the feels**
Why should you care about your site's speed and weight?
A bit slow, a bit chunky, so what?
âœ‹ who knows / uses Personas?

---

![](img/bongani.jpg)

^ Bongani, proto-Persona

---

## **Bongani**
## Cashier at Pluck n Pay
## **R5,000 / month**

![](img/bongani.jpg)

^ Persona: edge cases / worst case scenario!
But data's cheap, right?
She won't use the web! (FB!)

---

## "I want to look for<br/>a new job."

![](img/bongani.jpg)

^ No computer, so it's gonna be on her phone.
What's that going to cost her?

---

## httparchive.org
## **Average page size: 2.5MB**

![](img/httparchive-chart.png)

^ Doesn't seem so bad...
How much does that cost?

---

## Vodacom pre-paid
## **About R1.5 per page**

![](img/vodacom-data.jpg)

^ R9 for 15MB
R0.60 per MB
Usually worse than this
People limit usage by buying small amounts
Because it's expensive
Convert airtime to data: that means out of bundle rates

---

## Bongani looks for a job
## **10 pages a day: R15**
## Salary for the day: R240

![](img/bongani.jpg)

^ 5k / m
=> 1.2k / week
=> 240 day
R15 out of R240 for the day
5% of her income
