### **Agenda**

## 1. What?
## 2. So what?
## 3. Now what?

^ 1. What (is perf)?
2. So what?
So what (Part 2)?

# **1. What?**

---

# (Front-end)<br/>Performance

(e.g. vs back-end)
Simplified version of perf

---

# 1. Speed

![](img/speed.jpg)

^ Speed has perceived vs actual

---

# 2. Weight

![](img/weight.jpg)

^ Weight: how many MBs
Smaller better
Initial page load vs later

---

# **2. So what?**

^ Why should you care about your site's speed and weight?
A bit slow, a bit chunky, so what?
Gonna hit you in the feels
