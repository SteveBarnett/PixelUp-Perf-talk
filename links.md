# HTML

## Images

- Optimise your images and use as few as possible.
- Image optimisation: [Kraken](https://kraken.io/)
- Use the best format for your image: SVGs; JPGs (for photos, images with many colours); PNGs (for images with fewer colours); GIFs (for animations).
- Use the `picture` element and `srcset` to provide the image most suitable for the user's device. You can use [Picturefill](http://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/) to enable support for `picture` in browsers that don't support it yet.

# CSS

- Be careful with web font usage. More weights and more fonts can mean a heavier, slower, site. Also make sure you supply a suitable fallback font.
- Get CSS stats and look for improvements: [cssstats](http://cssstats.com/) and [stylestats](http://www.stylestats.org/).

# JavaScript
