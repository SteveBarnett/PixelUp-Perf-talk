This workshop is for WordPress Theme developers who are interested in improving the User Experience of their Themes.

We’ll start by reviewing why the Front-end performance of Themes (or any web site) is important, and what special considerations we have for a South African market. Then we’ll look at what indicators of good performance are, what tools we can use to help us, and make a checklist that we can use for reviewing sites.

We’ll use these ideas to look at a few off-the-shelf Themes as examples, and see where they might be able to improve on their Front-end performance. We’ll spend the second half of the workshop working on our own projects making them lighter, faster, and better for our users.


## About the talk

Performance matters. Slow and heavy sites and apps cost our users time and money. This is especially true in South Africa where phones are slower and data is more expensive. Some of the patterns we use, and the way we implement them, make things worse. In the end this means we lose customers and lose money. Ouch.

Dani and Steve will talk about the details of what performance means and how we can do better for our users. #perfmatters
